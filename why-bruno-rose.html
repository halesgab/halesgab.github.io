<p><b style="font-family: inherit; font-size: inherit; font-style: inherit;">Why BrunoRose?</b><br></p>
<p><b><br></b></p>
<p>My great grandfather, Armand Bruno, planted a single rose bush every spring and fall for the majority of his life.</p>
<p>After his passing in late 2013, a singular rose bloomed in our family's garden. We took this as a sign of safety and closure.</p>
<p>I, however, felt this tradition needed continuing. With BrunoRose Apparel, my great grandfathers roses can continue to bloom throughout the seasons.</p>

<p><b>Who am 'I'?</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p>
</p><p>I am Gabe Hales, a college student who runs this entire project out of my apartment in Michigan. I am the founder and sole operator of BrunoRose Apparel and with that I hope to bring a sense of personalism to every order. All photographs added to this site and my clothing are taken by myself unless stated otherwise, including product background images.</p>
