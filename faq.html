<p><b>COVID-19 RESPONSE</b></p><p><i>BRUNOROSE</i> is still shipping internationally during the current COVID-19 crisis (and across all regions)! As you probably know shipping times have slowed but that has not stopped the shipment of products! You will still receive a shipping confirmation after the order has shipped but it may take a day or two to update.</p><p>I am working hard to safely increase our capacity for products and continue to fulfill all orders received during this time.&nbsp;The printing times are improving for some shirts, especially for those orders coming from Europe.&nbsp;It is my hope that you continue to stay safe, healthy, and sane during this and if you have any other questions please let me know!</p><p><br></p><p><b>Do you ship Internationally?&nbsp;</b></p><p>Yes! I do, but sadly the cost is a bit more. However, I am working on lowering that cost in the future!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>When will my shirt ship?</b></p><p>Most shirts ship within 2-4 business day as all shirts are printed per order. This also means not one single Bruno Rose shirt is the same!</p><p><br></p><p><b>Why haven't I gotten a shipping confirmation yet?</b></p><p>Because BrunoRose is entirely run by one person, myself, I send out every shipping notification for each order. Some days a large amount of orders ship and life tends to get in the way as I have a job and full time school aside from running this company. This means that at times the confirmation email can be delayed by a day or two, but it will come eventually! If you're really hankering for your tracking number, just send me a quick email or contact me via Instagram.</p><p><br></p><p><b>I just received my shirt and its not as soft as I expected it to be?</b></p><p>Do not worry! Since every item is printed specifically for that order, they are immediately put into packaging and shipped out, which means after printing they are not washed or dried as to let the ink settle and get the package to you as soon as possible. In order to get your shirt feeling as soft as a babies bottom (and get rid of any leftover water-based ink splatter), just throw it in the washer and dryer for a normal cycle!</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>ALL ORDERS ARE FINAL. No refunds, cancellations or 'swaps' can be issued unless certain circumstances arise. Sorry for any inconvenience.&nbsp;</b></p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>If you have any other questions please don't hesitate to email or contact me via Instagram!</b></p><p><b>Thank you so much!</b></p>
